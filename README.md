# Customer-Segmentation-with-Machine-Learning-using-Python
This project will train you how to use Python using ML to analyze a real-world Problem, how to extract the most useful information from the dataset, how to pre-process the data using Python for improved performance and how to build the ML model.

### In this project, you will work on real-world e-commerce sales data and segment its customer base with Python, scikit-learn library.

The workflow of the project is as follows:

1. Business Case
2. Data Preparation
3. Segmentation with K-means Clustering
